KOALA v2.1.1 - CHANGELOG
* Added new bool functions and some math functions
* Fixed bug in Logger which prevented some informations to be displayed


KOALA v2.1.0 - CHANGELOG

### Koala is now COMPATIBLE WITH KONTAKT 5.6. Please read this Changelog carefully! ###

* Kontakt 5.6.5 support: XY Pad and new Math runtime
* New UI functions and color/status constants
* New function to load all the UI Ids of a Family inside an array
* New set of math functions with a killer curve function
* New integer conversion functions (inspired by the majestic work of BigBob † and his Math library)
* XY Pad is now fully supported by Koala and the Debugger: advanced functions to link cursors to UI controls or Engine Pars
* new automation functions
* new functions to convert the value of a UI control into a percentage value (0 to 100) or a decimal value (0 to 1, real number)
* Changed responsivity of the Debugger according to the UI size
* Koala is backward compatible with Kontakt 5.5.2, but the functions that use real numbers will return an error when applying the script to Kontakt 5.5.2. The same goes for XY pad, which has been introduced with Kontakt 5.6.5, thus it is not available in prior versions.

* Fixed create_text_edit macro
* Fixed a bug in the Logger which prevented the Persistence callback to be logged properly. The Logger cannot be used in the on init callback
* Improved 'timer' function. Now the data from 'timer' are loaded into a text variable in order to save a lot of scripting lines. New usage: 
	call timer
	message(@timer)

KOALA v2.0.6 - CHANGELOG
* Added functions to allow/disallow groups using EVENT_PAR_ALLOW_GROUP instead of allow_group and disallow_group functions.

* Updated change log messages. No other modifications were made. 

KOALA v2.0.2 - CHANGELOG

* User logs can now be shown/hidden just like the others.
* Added Persistency to all Logger categories.
