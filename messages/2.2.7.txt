KOALA v2.2.4 - CHANGELOG

KOALA v2.2.2 - CHANGELOG

KOALA v2.2.1 - CHANGELOG

KOALA v2.2.0 - CHANGELOG
* Added new element to the Debugger: the Live Monitor! This extremely powerful section features two main elements: the Oscilloscope can be used to monitor in realtime the content of an array or the change of a value over time, and can also be used to generate your own lookup tables according to the content of the Oscilloscope itself; the Array view displays the content of an array along with some useful informations. These features are handled with two functions: DEBUG.osc_value() and DEBUG.osc_array. Check out the Wiki for more info about this.
* Added new Math and Bool functions: math.clamp() and bool.is_in_range().

* ADDED EASING FUNCTIONS! With Kontakt 5.6's new real Math operations, it's now possible to use easing functions to enhance your UI animations and handle complex curves for any kind of application, be it UI or Engine-based. Take a look here http://easings.net/ for more info!
* Added new real Math constants (~MATH_2PI, ~MATH_LN2 and more)

KOALA v2.1.0 - CHANGELOG

### Koala is now COMPATIBLE WITH KONTAKT 5.6. Please read this Changelog carefully! ###

* Kontakt 5.6.5 support: XY Pad and new Math runtime
* New UI functions and color/status constants
* New function to load all the UI Ids of a Family inside an array
* New set of math functions with a killer curve function
* New integer conversion functions (inspired by the majestic work of BigBob † and his Math library)
* XY Pad is now fully supported by Koala and the Debugger: advanced functions to link cursors to UI controls or Engine Pars
* new automation functions
* new functions to convert the value of a UI control into a percentage value (0 to 100) or a decimal value (0 to 1, real number)
* Changed responsivity of the Debugger according to the UI size
* Koala is backward compatible with Kontakt 5.5.2, but the functions that use real numbers will return an error when applying the script to Kontakt 5.5.2. The same goes for XY pad, which has been introduced with Kontakt 5.6.5, thus it is not available in prior versions.

* Fixed create_text_edit macro
* Fixed a bug in the Logger which prevented the Persistence callback to be logged properly. The Logger cannot be used in the on init callback
* Improved 'timer' function. Now the data from 'timer' are loaded into a text variable in order to save a lot of scripting lines. New usage: 
	call timer
	message(@timer)
